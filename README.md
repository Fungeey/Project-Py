# Project-Py
In an attempt to learn [Python](https://www.python.org/), I made this repository to hold all of my tiny projects.

### File IO
- **PDFMerger.py**: Merges multiple PDF files together.
### Image Processing
- **Greyscaler.py**: Converts an image to black and white.
- **BoxBlur.py**: Blurs an image using the [BoxBlur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_blur) algorithm.
